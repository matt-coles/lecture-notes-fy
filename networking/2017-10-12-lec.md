### Networking

A typical email application will need to apply a presentation encapsulation and add application layer headers, To/From etc. There is a standard out there, the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) for encoding data in a safe way. MIME was originally developed for email, but it is useful in many other contexts, such as Web page delivery.

This is similarly true for the session layer. If a persistent session is required, the application must provide the code to do this. Many applications like FTP do not. If TCP/IP had session management, applications would get this 'for free'. The counter-argument is that many applications do not want session management and should not have to pay the overhead. In the real world, there is no session management in TCP so you need to reimplement this, or rather find a library to do this and write the code to incorporate this. i.e Taco Bell programming.

# Parallel

OpenMP is similar to the superstep model of parallelism, and has simple
annotations with things like `#pragma omp parallel for`, this informs the
compiler that we want the for loop to be run in parallel. When this is run the
loop is split into some number of chunks running on some number of threads. The
runtime system determines the number of chunks and the number of threads.
Typically the number of chunks is the same as the number of threads which is
usually the same as the number of processors in the systems but this is not
required. The runtime will create parallel versions with different, _private_
version of the loop variable per thread. The `parallel for` construct knows that
the loop variable must be private. The other variables in the loop will not be
made private. By using the construct we are telling the compiler that it is safe
to do this in parallel, but does not protect us from data races. OpenMP provides
a simple mechanism but still no analysis.

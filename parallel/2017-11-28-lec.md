# Parallel

Producer/consumer pattern.

Advantages are that they can work at their own rate, and there is less
synchronisation, and therefore there is less waiting around. The produce and
consumer are now working asynchronously. When the producer produces data it
writes it into the next free place in the buffer, unless the buffer is full,
when the producer must wait until a place becomes free by the consumer reading
some data. Symmetrically when the consumer wants to consume data it reads it
from the next position in the buffer. Unless the buffer is empty when the
consumer must wait until some data arrives by the producer writing it. So there
is synchronisation, just less of it and only when necessary.

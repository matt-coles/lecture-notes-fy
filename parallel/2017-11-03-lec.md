# Compilers

Taking a sequential language and adding parallel solutions to it is not usually
a very good solution. But you can add a library of functions that will add
parallelism. A good example of this are the POSIX extensions to C, such as
`pthread_mutex_init`. There are a couple more that we need to make parallel
programs.

It is important to always use the primitives in order to utilise parallelism
because we cannot always tell the hardware and software not to mess around with
the code. For example, the CPU could be making use of out of order execution on
machine instructions to improve efficiency. So even given un-reordered code, the
CPU might, while running, decide the loads are independent and do them in
different orders. This way we will need to use things such as a "memory fence",
to tell both the compiler and the hardware to not reorder things. (Reminder SYNC
instruction in MIPS). There are also more subtle mechanisms to avoid bringing in
a _global_ synchronisation point.

The specification for a parallel language needs a memory model to describe how
memory reads and writes are visible to multiple processors. This informs the
compiler and hardware about what kinds of reordering area allowable and what kinds
of memory consistency across processors are needed. For example, some reads or
some writes may be reordered but others should not. Fortunately for us, these
days the primitives and higher level constructs look after all the details for
us.
